## Compiling Flare files

```
java Transpiler <out-directory-path> <flare-file> <flare-file> ...
```

All Flare files must have the `.flare` extension in order to be recognized and read by the transpiler.

Resulting `.h` and `.cpp` files will be written to the `<out-directory-path>` along with the executable
`a.exe`
